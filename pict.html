                        <p>
                            An incident report is a formal document that records and documents an event, 
                            such as an accident, injury, or near miss, that occurs in a workplace
                        </p>

                        <h2>Information</h2>
                        <p>
                            Information is an abstract concept that refers to something which has the power to inform. 
                            At the most fundamental level, it pertains to the interpretation (perhaps formally) of that which may be sensed, 
                            or their abstractions. Any natural process that is not completely random

                        <h2>Unique Incident ID</h2>
                        <p>
                            Incident identifier means......... the unique number assigned by the reporting entity to a series of closed claims
                            that result from a single incident or related series of incidents of actual or alleged medical malpractice.

                        <h2>Your Status</h2>
                        <p>
                            "Tracking status" refers to the current state of a package, item, or delivery, 
                            indicating where it is in the delivery process, while "time status" provides 
                            the estimated time of arrival (ETA) or current time associated with that tracking status, 
                            essentially telling you when the item is expected to reach its destination.
